# Coding workflow preferences

1. Focus on the areas of code relevant to the task

2. Do not touch code that is unrelated to the task

3. Write thorough tests for all major functionality

4. Avoid making major changes to the patterns and architecture of how a feature works, after it has shown to work well, unless explicitly instructed

5. Always think about what other methods and areas of code might be affected by code changes
